- 👋 Hi, I’m @FlipTheDream
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps and Blockchain development as a long time technologist wanting to recapture the joys of development given new tech, developing industries and new tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang given the ability to rapidly develop, cross-compilation, speed and clean dependency/packaging manament. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything DeFi and blockchain related.
